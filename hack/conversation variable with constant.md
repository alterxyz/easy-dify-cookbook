# Assigning Constants to Conversation Variables

Currently, conversation variables cannot directly be assigned constant values. However, there's a workaround:

1\. Create a new variable with the desired constant as its default value.

![new variable with default value](/images/21.png)

2\. Use this new variable's default value to overwrite your original conversation variable.

![assign var with another var(with default value)](/images/22.png)  
This method allows you to effectively assign a constant to your conversation variable.
