# Python Debug at Code Execution in Dify

The code execution does not support, but you can return string.

There is a quick example:

```python
def main():
    error_message = "HelloWorld!"
    try:
        x = 1 / 0
    except Exception as e:
        x = 0
        error_message += str(e)
    
    return{
        "number": x,
        "debug": error_message
    }
```
